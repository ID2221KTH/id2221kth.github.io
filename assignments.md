This course consists of five review questions, two lab assignments, and one final project. All the assignments should be done in groups of two and have to be submitted before their deadlines.
All the assignments are graded A-F, and students should submit them before the deadlines. A late submission will reduce the assignment's grade level by one. That is, A will become B, B will become C,
and so on. To deliver the labs and the final project, in addition to the source code, students should give an oral presentation of their code and answer questions that include basic and advanced questions.
The details of the grading are presented in the slides of the introduction lecture

# **Review Questions**
We have one review question per week. Each review question has five points.

* **RQ1:** Distributed filesystems and NoSQL databases [[pdf](/assignments/review_questions1.pdf)]
* **RQ2:** MapReduce and Spark [[pdf](/assignments/review_questions2.pdf)]
* **RQ3:** Spark SQL and stream processing [[pdf](/assignments/review_questions3.pdf)]
* **RQ4:** Spark streaming and graph processing [[pdf](/assignments/review_questions4.pdf)]

# **Lab Assignments**
The lab assignments span over different topics of the course. For each lab, a zip file is given that includes instructions for doing the assignment.

* **Lab 1:**
 In this lab assignment, you will practice the basics of data-intensive programming by setting up HDFS, HBase, Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Spark SQL and implementing simple applications on them.
The assignment has two parts. Lab0 is a complete guide on setting up and working with HDFS and HBase and implementing a code using MapReduce. All the codes for Lab0 are given to you, and you need to go
through the steps to execute them. In the oral presentation, you should show an installed HDFS and HBase on your machine and show you can run the given code. Lab1 is an assignment about Spark and Spark SQL. In this lab, you are given a dataset and a set of questions, and you need to implement codes for each question. As a deliverable, you need to submit the codes and a report showing the results of running your codes for
each question. You can download the assignment from [here](/assignments/lab1.zip).
* **Lab 2:** 
In the second lab, you will work with Spark Streaming, Structured Streaming and GraphX. You can download the assignment from [here](/assignments/lab2.zip).

# **Project**
You should define your own project by writing at most one page description of the project, and getting your project proposal approved by the examiner. The project proposal should cover the following headings:
* **Problem description:** what is the problem that you will be investigating?
* **Tools:** what tools you are going to use? In the course we mainly used Spark, but you are free to explore new tools and technologies.
* **Data:** what data will you use and how are you going to collect it? 
* **Methodology and algorithm:** what method(s) or algorithm(s) are you proposing? 

### What to deliver
You can implement your code using Jupyter Notebook or as a stand alone application. You should submit a zip file containing your code and a short report (two to three pages) about what you have done, the dataset, your method, your results, and how to run the code.
