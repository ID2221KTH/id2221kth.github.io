This course consists of seven review questions, two lab assignments, and one final project. All the assignments should be done in groups of two and have to be submitted before their deadlines.
All the assignments are graded. The review questions are graded A-F. The two lab assignments have A, C, and E grading. To deliver the labs, students should submit the source codes before the deadlines and
give an oral presentation about their implementations. They also need to answer to the questions that include basic and advanced questions. If a group implement the labs and answer all the questions, 
they will get A. If they can only answer the basic questions they will get C, and if they cannot answer the questions, they will get E. The final project has A-D grading. Students should propose a topic 
to implement as the final project. Based on the complexity of the proposal it could be an A-level proposal or a C-level proposal. This assignment also includes an oral presentation. If students implement
the proposed topic, and can answer the questions in the oral exam, they will get either A or C, depends on the difficulty level of the topic. If they just do the implementation, but cannot answer the 
questions, the grades would be B or D, respectively.

### The Final Grade
The final grade is the average of the two labs, the project, and the final exam. To compute the final grade, you can map A-F to 5-1, and take the average. The floating values are rounded up if they are more than
half, otherwise they are rounded down. For example, 3.6 will be rounded to 4, and 4.2 will be rounded to 4.

# **Reading Assignments**
For the reading assignment, you are asked to choose a paper form the list of given papers, or propose a paper youself that should be approved by the instructures.
The reviews should have the following sections:
* **Motivation:** describe the motivation of the paper, and explain WHY the addressed problem is interesting and important to be solved.
* **Contributions:** explain the main contributions of the paper, and present WHAT the solved problems are.
* **Solution:** very briefly explain HOW the authors solve the mentioned problems.
* **Strong and weak points:** What are the strong and weak points of the paper? 

### General reading instruction
* How to read a paper [[pdf](/papers/paper-reading.pdf)]
* How to write a review [[pdf](/papers/review-writing.pdf)]
* It is strongly recommended to use the given templates [[latex](/papers/latex_template.tex)] [[word](/papers/word_template.doc)]

# **Project**
You should define your own project by writing at most one page description of the project, and getting your project proposal approved by the examiner. The project proposal should cover the following headings:
* **Problem description:** what is the problem that you will be investigating?
* **Tools:** what tools you are going to use? In the course we mainly used Spark, but you are free to explore new tools and technologies.
* **Data:** what data will you use and how are you going to collect it? 
* **Methodology and algorithm:** what method(s) or algorithm(s) are you proposing? 

### What to deliver
You can implement your code using Jupyter Notebook or as a stand alone application. You should submit a zip file containing your code and a short report (two to three pages) about what you have done, the dataset, your method, your results, and how to run the code.
