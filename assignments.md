This course consists of seven review questions, two reading assignments, two lab assignments, and one final project. All the assignments should be done in groups of two and have to be submitted before their deadlines. 
The review questions and the reading assignments are Pass/Fail assignments, and the labs and the project are graded from A to E. To pass the course, you should pass all the review and the reading assignments, and
get at least E in all the other assignments and the final exam.

### The Final Grade
The final grade is the average of the two labs, the project, and the final exam. To compute the final grade, you can map A-F to 5-1, and take the average. The floating values are rounded up if they are more than
half, otherwise they are rounded down. For example, 3.6 will be rounded to 4, and 4.2 will be rounded to 4.

# **Lab Assignments**
The lab assignments span over different topics of the course. For each lab, a zip file is given that includes instructions for doing the assignment.

* **Lab 1:** In this lab assignment you will practice the basics of data intensive programming by setting up HDFS, HBase, Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, and Spark SQL, and implementing simple applications on them. You can download the assignment from [[here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/izydgvh6tgo5ql6/lab1.zip?dl=0)].

# **Reading Assignments**
For each reading assignment, you are asked to choose a paper form the list of given papers, or propose a paper youself that should be approved by the instructures.
The reviews should have the following sections:
* **Motivation:** describe the motivation of the paper, and explain WHY the addressed problem is interesting and important to be solved.
* **Contributions:** explain the main contributions of the paper, and present WHAT the solved problems are.
* **Solution:** very briefly explain HOW the authors solve the mentioned problems.
* **Strong and weak points:** What are the strong and weak points of the paper? 

### General reading instruction

# **Project**
You should define your own project by writing at most one page description of the project, and getting your project proposal approved by the examiner. The project proposal should cover the following headings:
* **Problem description:** what is the problem that you will be investigating?
* **Tools:** what tools you are going to use? In the course we mainly used Spark, but you are free to explore new tools and technologies.
* **Data:** what data will you use and how are you going to collect it? 
* **Methodology and algorithm:** what method(s) or algorithm(s) are you proposing? 

### What to deliver
You can implement your code using Jupyter Notebook or as a stand alone application. You should submit a zip file containing your code and a short report (two to three pages) about what you have done, the dataset, your method, your results, and how to run the code.
